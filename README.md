# SimpleBrowser

This is a simple browser, made with PyQt5, and using PyQtWebEngine to display the websites.
There's also a windows executable version, for people who don't wanna see the command prompt, lol.


Installation

Install PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine by running: pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine

That's it, no other thrid-party libraries required.
Now, just run the script/exe, and it should work.
The exe should run regardless of whether you have the libraries installed or not, but you should still install them to make sure :)
